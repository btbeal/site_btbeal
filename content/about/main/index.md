  I started my career aiming to make a difference by way of healthcare. As I progressed through my PharmD, I realized that I may be able to make a broader impact through the use of data. So... I began teaching myself R and the rest feels like history.
  
  I'm currently employed at Flatiron Health as a Quantitative Scientist, where I conduct cancer research and work with our engineers and providers to rethink the way we may automate our data quality.
