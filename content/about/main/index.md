intro: |
  I'm currently employed at Flatiron Health as a Quantitative Scientist where I collaborate daily with our engineers and healthcare providers to rethink how we can use our rich oncology data to affect patient lives. My job changes on any given day and ranges from conducting research to automating processes such as quality assessment. Also, very importantly, I lead our Whisky club.
  
  Outside of the office, I really enjoy being around people in any capacity - biking, hiking, craft beer, and chess. But I also enjoy a good book.
  
  Anyways, I'm happy you're here and appreciate you sticking around thus far. Check out some of my side projects and contact me if you see something you like!
